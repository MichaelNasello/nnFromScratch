# Neural Networks from Scratch
***

The goal is to build a Python package providing the necessary functionality for 
training Neural Network models from scratch. No Tensorflow or Pytorch. Just 
old-fashioned Python and its computational library, Numpy.

If you have any comments or concerns, I would love the feedback 
(e: mlnasell@uwaterloo.ca)!
